	Need to compress Data:
		Lossless vs Lossly compression
		use both?

		scan each of the audiofile and try get patterns
			redundancy
			psychoaudio:
				break audio track into all of the differnet frequency bands
				20hz-100hz 100hz-500hz and so on compress higher hz to lower bit rates

		create Datastructure for holding the patterns by pattern id
